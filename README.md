* An open letter signed by hundreds of prominent figures in the tech industry, including Elon Musk, has called for a six-month pause in the training of new powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The letter warns of the profound risks that recent advances in AI pose to society and humanity. It comes shortly after the release of OpenAI's GPT-4, which has led researchers to revise their expectations for when artificial general intelligence (AGI) will surpass human cognitive ability. The signatories are concerned that an AI arms race could lead to catastrophic consequences. The letter emphasizes the need for careful planning and management of advanced AI, highlighting the lack of such efforts despite the rapid development and deployment of increasingly powerful AI systems. The signatories, which include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and renowned academics in the field of AI, propose a six-month pause to continue safety research and establish shared safety protocols for AI design and development. They argue that decisions regarding the development of AI should not be left solely to unelected tech leaders and call for independent oversight. The letter concludes with a call for a pause in the race towards larger and unpredictable AI models and advocates for a period of reflection and preparation to ensure the safe development of AI. Signatories express concerns about the risks associated with AI systems that are not fully understood, capable of propagating propaganda and untruth, automating jobs, and potentially replacing humans. They stress the importance of slowing down AI development to allow society to adapt and develop alternative, safe AGI architectures.
